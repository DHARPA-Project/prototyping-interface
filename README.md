## General
This prototyping interface is built with a React front-end and a Python backend. Both end exchange data via Flask. 
User action that triggers operations on the dataset (such as edits or advanced data analysis) are processed by Python and then sent back to the front-end.

## Current stage
The available workflows are currently under development and aren't for the moment fully functional. They should reach a Minimum Viable Product test stage in the next months. This means that they will be ready for user tests for functionalities and design iterations before being ready for alpha and then beta version.

## Installation
(coming soon)

## How to use

### 1. Home Page
At this stage, only the left part of the panel is active. This left part enables access to the workflows that are currently available.
In the future, the right panel will give users the possibility to create their own workflows, and freely access the various functionalities that are shown on the left, without following a special order.
