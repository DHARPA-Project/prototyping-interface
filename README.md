## General
This prototyping interface's goal is to enable the production of functional prototypes for user testing purposes.
It is built with a React front-end and a Python backend. Both end exchange data via Flask. User actions that trigger operations on their initial dataset (such as edits or advanced data analysis) are processed by Python and then sent back to the front-end.

## Current stage
The available code is currently under development and isn't for the moment fully functional.
The first modules should reach a Minimum Viable Product Test stage in the next weeks and months. This means that they will be ready for user testing, in order to enable further functionalities and design iterations, before being released (possibly with a different technical stack) as an alpha and then beta version.

## Installation
